								INTRODUCTION
		1.1	Introduction
        		 Myanmar is one of the most interesting places in South East Asia. The world 'Myanmar' represents all the ethnic
			 groups living in the country. The population of Myanmar is 60 million people The project is “Who Is Who In Myanmar” .
			 Many kinds of partitions in Myanmar.Among them,describe any five partitions in Myanmar.It include 
              		
			i.Candidates from Parties,
               		ii.Member of Parliament(Union,State,Region),
               		iii.Business Leaders,
               		iv.Modern Historical Figures         (33Comrades,Freedom,Fighters,Regional Leaders,etc….)    
			and v.Celebrities(BeautyPageants,Models,Actors,Vocalists,Directors,Promoters,Socialites,
			Social Media Influence,etc...).We used UI/UX update design for our project.We can also used Javascript,Materialize CSS
			and Materialize Design Lite(MDL).


		1.2	Background of the Project
			    People has received  personalities of each famous person by a project.
			    When the viewers search on the main menu, the project displayed their personalities with photos and texts.
			     There are many processes to develop manual system and it may be more cost and time waste. So we decided to develop the project to reduce the problems.


		1.3	GitHub
		
		1.3.1	Details of the GitHub
	
			GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code.
			It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as
			adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking,
			feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
 			 GitHub offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts which are commonly used to host open-source software 
			projects. As of June 2018,  GitHub reports having over 28 million users and 57 million repositories (including 28 million public repositories.

		
		(i)What is GitHub
•	 GitHub is at heart a Git repository hosting service, i.e. a
 cloud-based source code management or version control system, but that’s just the beginning. In addition, GitHub implements features for code review (pull requests, diffs, and review requests), project management (including issue tracking and assignment), integrations with other developer tools, team management, documentation, and “social coding.”
•	Something like a social networking site for programmers, GitHub is an open environment where programmers can 
freely share and collaborate (even ad hoc) 
on open source code. GitHub makes it easy to find useful code, copy repositories for your own use, and submit changes to others’ projects. As a result, GitHub has become home to virtually every open source project of any importance.
(ii)Learn GitHub	
Why learn Git? Ever have a "I lost all my work and I have a                                                  deadline the next day" moment? Git is the most popular version control tool - something that developers use to save all relevant versions of their work to avoid moments like those.

(iii)How To Create GitHub Account?
•	Play vim adventuregame
•	Do github tutorial
•	Build repository

1.3.2 Details of Git Bash 	
      Git Bash is a bash shell for use on Microsoft Windows           systems, to enable the git repository functions on that platform.Git Bash for Windows is a package that is comprised of two parts:
	Git: It is a version control system (VCS) which tracks the file changes.
	Bash: It is a unix shell command line interface commonly used in different linux machines.
                                                                                 
(i)Git
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. Git is free and open source software distributed under the terms of the GNC General Public License version 2.
(ii)Bash
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. It has been distributed widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple’s macOS. A version is also available for Windows 10.
Bash is command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.

1.4 Objective of the Project

2.1.1 Materialize CSS
Materialize is basically CSS framework which is used to create responsive websites. Materialize framework is basically built on google’s material design concept. Materialize framework is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Materialize CSS is a UI component library which is created 
with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is created and designed by Google. Materialize CSS is known as Materialize Design.
Google’s goal is to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform. It is used to construct attractive, consistent, and functional web pages and web apps.
Material design in its purest form: shadows, layers, flat icons, bright colors, and conservation of space for mobile. Bebber’s Gooey Menu offer something new and unique without sacrificing the best advantages of Google’s design style. It is a modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design.

2.1.2	Materialize Design Lite (MDL)
                 Today we are releasing our effort to bring this to websites using vanilla CSS, HTML, JavaScript. We’re calling it Material Design Lite. MDL makes it easy to add a material design look and feel to your websites. MDL includes a rich set of components including material design buttons, text-fields.

2.2 Use of Software Applications

2.2.1 Pycharm
                     Pycharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming specifically for the Python language. It is specially for the Python language. It is developed by Czech company JetBrains. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with Version control system (vcses) and supports web development with Django.
                    If you’re using macOS or Linux your computer already has Python installed. You can get Python from Python.org.

2.2.2 What is Heroku?
Heroku is the following:
	A Web Application Deployment Model
	A Platform-as-a-Service
	A Polyglot Platform
	A Cloud Platform
Benefits of the Heroku platform are:
1.Cost: Heroku’s platform-as-a-service helps companies make tremendous cost savings because it eliminates the need for expensive infrastructure and all the time and money it takes to manage servers.
2.Productivity: From start to finish, every detail of Heroku is designed to maximica efficiency and save developers time. It is intultiv, powerful, and easy to use.
3.Support: The Heroku Operational Experience(Opex)lends immense support, with troubleshooting tips and quick diagnostic tools to help you get to the root of the problem fast and fix it even faster.
3. The Ecosystem: With Heroku Elements, developers can extend apps using a wide variety of add-ons from third party cloud services. So the options are nearly endless.

3.1.3 Flask	
   Flask is a small and powerful web framework for Python. It's easy to learn and simple to use, enabling you to build your web app in a short amount of time.
   Before getting started, we need to install Flask. Because systems vary, things can sporadically go wrong during these steps. If they do, like we all do, just Google the error message or leave a comment describing the problem
